I am a physical chemist and R&D engineer with a passion for exploring coding topics in my spare time. Recently, I have started learning ChatGPT as a coding and technical writing assistant, with a focus on prompting techniques and memory context management, as documented in [ChatGPTExploratoryPrompting][]. My interests also include the technical aspects of SQLite, with my latest project, [SQLiteMP][], dedicated to developing a pure SQL implementation of a hierarchical category (class/tag) management system embeddable in an SQLite database. Some of my earlier projects include the advanced [SQLite SQL Tutorial][], the [SQLite ICU][] project, which focuses on building custom versions of SQLite on Windows using [MSYS2/MinGW][MSYS2] and [MSBuild][] toolchains, and the object-oriented VBA6 [SQLite C/ADO VBA Library][SQLiteC for VBA], which wraps the standard SQLite C API and the ADODB library.

Outside of my professional and technical pursuits, I enjoy playing online blitz chess variants, including Crazyhouse, Antichess, Atomic, and Three-check.
