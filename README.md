I am a physical chemist and R&D engineer with a passion for exploring coding topics in my spare time. Recently, I began using ChatGPT as a coding and technical writing assistant, focusing on prompting techniques and memory context management, as documented in [ChatGPTExploratoryPrompting][]. My current interests include the guided analysis of non-standard semistructured data, emphasizing the inference of structure and format with limited context. This process involves generating structured blueprint specifications and leveraging ChatGPT for assisted code development to handle the analyzed data. I also take advantage of ChatGPT's ability to interpret and annotate Python code, as well as generate extensive test suites, including age cases.

I am also interested in the technical aspects of SQLite. My latest project, [SQLiteMP][], is dedicated to developing a pure SQL implementation of a hierarchical category (class/tag) management system embeddable in an SQLite database. While SQL appears to be naturally more difficult for generative AI (compared to expressive general purpose languages, such as Python), I discovered that ChatGPT is capable of semantic SQL code interpretation. I have also replaced some of my SQL snippets with those predictively generated by ChatGPT based on plain text subject description (code description was not provided). My previous projects include the advanced [SQLite SQL Tutorial][], the [SQLite ICU][] project - focused on building custom SQLite versions on Windows using [MSYS2/MinGW][MSYS2] and [MSBuild][] toolchains - and the object-oriented VBA6 [SQLite C/ADO VBA Library][SQLiteC for VBA], which wraps the standard SQLite C API and the ADODB library.

Another area of interest is ChatGPT assisted structure extraction from technical texts, particularly those well-suited to structured formats, such as workflow descriptions and guides. ChatGPT can also helpful in guided topic exploration and transformation of brainstorming results and technical subject focused bunch-of-thoughts kind of texts.

Outside of my professional and technical pursuits, I enjoy playing online blitz chess variants, including Crazyhouse, Antichess, Atomic, and Three-check.
