I am a physical chemist and R&D engineer who occasionally explores coding topics for fun. I have published several projects using VBA and SQLite on my [GitHub Pages][PChemGuy GitHub Pages] site. Recently, I began exploring and learning ChatGPT, documenting my efforts in this [repository][ChatGPTExploratoryPrompting]. In addition to my professional and technical interests, I enjoy playing online blitz chess variants, including Crazyhouse, Antichess, Atomic, and Three-check.
