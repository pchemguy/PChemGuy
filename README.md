I am a physical chemist and R&D engineer with a passion for exploring coding topics in my spare time. Recently, I have started learning ChatGPT as a coding and technical writing assistant, focusing on prompting techniques and memory context management, as documented in [ChatGPTExploratoryPrompting][]. My interests also include the technical aspects of SQLite, with my latest project, [SQLiteMP][], focused on developing a database-embeddable, pure SQL implementation of the materialized paths (MPs) tree model.

Outside of my professional and technical pursuits, I enjoy playing online blitz chess variants, including Crazyhouse, Antichess, Atomic, and Three-check.
