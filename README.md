I am a physical chemist and R&D engineer with a passion for exploring coding, technical writing, and generative AI topics in my spare time.

Recently, I began using ChatGPT as a coding and technical writing assistant, focusing on prompting techniques and memory context management, as documented in [ChatGPTExploratoryPrompting][]. My current interests include the guided analysis of non-standard semistructured data, emphasizing the inference of structure and format with limited context. This process involves generating structured blueprint specifications and leveraging ChatGPT for assisted code development to handle the analyzed data. Additionally, I take advantage of ChatGPT's capabilities to interpret, annotate, and document Python code, as well as to generate extended test suites, including edge cases.

I am also interested in the technical aspects of SQLite. My latest project, [SQLiteMP][], is dedicated to developing a pure SQL implementation of a hierarchical category (class/tag) management system embeddable in an SQLite database. While SQL can be more challenging for generative AI compared to expressive general-purpose languages like Python, I have discovered that ChatGPT is capable of semantic SQL code interpretation. In some cases, I have replaced my SQL snippets with those predictively generated by ChatGPT based solely on plain text subject descriptions, without providing any code logic descriptions. My previous projects include the advanced [SQLite SQL Tutorial][], the [SQLite ICU][] project, focused on building custom SQLite versions on Windows using [MSYS2/MinGW][MSYS2] and [MSBuild][] toolchains, and the object-oriented VBA6 [SQLite C/ADO VBA Library][SQLiteC for VBA], which wraps the standard SQLite C API and the ADODB library.

Another area of interest is ChatGPT-assisted structure extraction from technical texts, particularly those well-suited to structured formats such as workflow descriptions and guides. ChatGPT has also proven helpful in guided topic exploration and transforming brainstorming results or technical "bunch-of-thoughts" texts into coherent, structured outputs.

Outside of my professional and technical pursuits, I enjoy playing online blitz chess variants, including Crazyhouse, Antichess, Atomic, and Three-check.
